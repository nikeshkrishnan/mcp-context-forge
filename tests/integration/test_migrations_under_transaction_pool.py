"""Integration tests for Alembic bootstrap under transaction-pool PgBouncer.

PgBouncer in ``pool_mode=transaction`` shares one Postgres server backend
across many pgbouncer "client" connections. Session-scoped Postgres advisory
locks (``pg_advisory_lock``) live on the server backend, not on the pgbouncer
client connection — so when a client disconnects, the server backend goes
back into pgbouncer's pool *with the lock still held*. A subsequent client
that happens to land on a different backend cannot take the same lock: from
Postgres's point of view, the lock is held by the orphaned session.

That is the mechanism that makes ``mcpgateway.bootstrap_db.main()`` hang
when multiple gateway replicas start concurrently behind a transaction-
pooling PgBouncer: N replicas race for ``pg_try_advisory_lock``, one wins,
another client reuses that server backend mid-upgrade, and the remaining
replicas then spin against an orphaned lock until the retry loop gives up.

This module pins the mechanism as a first-class fact so future refactors
to ``bootstrap_db.py`` can be validated against the same known-bad
substrate.

This test documents the PgBouncer mechanism and should keep passing even
after the fix lands — the fix works *around* this behavior, it does not
eliminate it.

Requirements:
    - Reproduction stack running:

        docker compose -f tests/integration/fixtures/transaction_pool/docker-compose.yml \\
            up -d postgres pgbouncer

    - ``PGBOUNCER_URL`` / ``POSTGRES_URL`` point at that stack (defaults match
      the ports exposed in the fixture compose file).

    - **For the end-to-end compose test only**: a built local gateway image
      (``mcpgateway/mcpgateway:latest`` — produced by ``make docker``) AND
      ``MCPGATEWAY_TEST_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_E2E=1`` to opt into the destructive
      path. Without the env var the e2e test skips with a clear message.

Usage:
    uv run pytest tests/integration/test_migrations_under_transaction_pool.py -v --with-integration

    # Including the destructive end-to-end test:
    MCPGATEWAY_TEST_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_E2E=1 uv run pytest \\
