"""Unit tests for ``mcpgateway.utils.check_schema_at_head``.

The module is the gateway pod's K8s startup-probe entrypoint — it runs
every five seconds and its exit code determines whether a pod is allowed
to serve traffic. The contract this module exists to pin:

  * exit 0  ⇔  ``alembic_at_head`` returned True
  * exit 1  ⇔  ``alembic_at_head`` returned False
  * exit 1  ⇔  any exception inside the try/except is swallowed and
                logged at WARNING (operator-visible at the project's
                default log level)
  * ``engine.dispose()`` is called on every code path

A regression here either fails open (probe returns 0 with no schema —
gateway pods reach Ready against an empty DB and 500 on the first
request) or fails closed forever (an exception propagates with a non-1
exit code that K8s might re-classify). Neither is acceptable; both are
silent. These tests are the truth-table that catches such regressions
at PR time rather than in production pod logs.
